      The behavior the Time Series Insights service should take when the
      environment's capacity has been exceeded. If "PauseIngress" is specified,
      new events will not be read from the event source. If "PurgeOldData" is
      specified, new events will continue to be read and old events will be
      deleted from the environment. The default behavior is PurgeOldData.
